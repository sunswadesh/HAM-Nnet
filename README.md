# HAM-Nnet
The High Arctic Magnetometer Neural Networks (HAM-Nnet) is collection of neural network models that were trained on long term magnetometer data from the high arctic stations. The models give accurate predictions of spatially resolved magnetic disturbances observed over the surface of the earth as well as create global images of SECs based on the local magnetic disturbances.
